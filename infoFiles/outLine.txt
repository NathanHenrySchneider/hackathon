main objects:

user (local)

server (remote)


suplementary objects

seed 1/2 (local) a subspace of the key space

rule set 1/2 (local) rng

seed 1/2 (remote) a subspace of the key space

rule set 1/2 (remote) rng

keyspace (local) (includes machine id, user id)(also in hex?)

keyspace (remote) ()


main process:

user creates account
first seed 1/2 is generated using some type of information from user
first rule set 1/2 is generated using some type of information from user
first seed 1/2 is generated using some type of information from server
first rule set 1/2 is generated using some type of information from server

code is run using the pieces from both
first keyspace is determined
keyspace is stored locally and remotely
(not machine specific)
the keyspaces are compared to make sure they match

second seed 1/2 is generated using some type of information from keyspace
second rule set 1/2 is generated using some type of information from keyspace
second seed 1/2 is generated using some type of information from server
second rule set 1/2 is generated using some type of information from server

A new key is generated every 24 hours and it is updated when the user next
communicates with the server


suplementary process:

generating first seed:
