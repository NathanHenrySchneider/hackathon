Using elementary cellular automata rule sets to generate keys that result in
a key space, we can add more robust protection for our customers and their
customers. Elementary cellular automata generates continuous unique binary
arrays based on rule sets and seed data. By having users and servers hold
different components of the rule sets and seed data, we can control the process
of verifying permissions. The servers are able to use a subspace of the key
space for authentication. This subspace theoretically has no upper bound for
 size and this could be implemented in two, three, four, etc dimensions
 yielding further complexity to the algorithm.

 A user would have their own part
 of seed data and part of a rule set, the server would randomly generate the
 other part of the seed data and the other part of the rule set. Then a random
 subspace would be selected from the generated key space, which would replace
 the user's previous seed and rule set. Upon the next use of the algorithm,
 the server would check to see that the the user's seed data and rule set are
 in fact derived from the previous subspace. This would result in unique
 changing keys to protect what is sensitive to users.
