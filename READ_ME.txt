The final version of our code is in the directory core

To run this code you must have a compatible version of Python installed on your machine.
You must have at least two command line windows open.
Begin by indexing into the directory in both windows.
In the first window run the server.py file.
Then in the second window run the client.py file.
To start a session between a new or preexisting user, run the client.py. file.
Further interaction with the UI should be self explanatory.
